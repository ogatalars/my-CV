# Felipe Ogata's Portfolio

## Introduction

Hello, how are you? I hope you are well! My name is Felipe Ogata, but everyone calls me Ogata, which is my surname. In short, I have three academic degrees: Economics, Law, and now Systems Analysis and Development. Despite the differences, my main focus now is on Information Technology. I have been working as a developer since 2020, when I made my career change, and I intend to continue in it because I love technology so much! I work as a software engineer (full-stack developer), working with Python in the back end, using FastAPI and Flask, and in the front end, I use JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. I prefer front-end development.
